using system;

class Program 
{
	static void Main() 
	{
		console.writeline("hello, world!");
	}
}


in this code system is collection of class and functions that we need to use them but for simplicity
we grouped them in one file called system and using this file we can access to all of these methods
and that's what we called namespace.
so namespaces are used to organize our code and make life more easy for developers
